## 1. Dependency Inversion Principle
> - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
> - Abastractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon absractions.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle

> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## 3. Composition over inheritance

Prefer composition unless inheritance is strongly needed.

## 4. Law of Demeter

> Law of multiple dots

Do not entagle a method with another objects' dependencies.

## 5. Tell Don't Ask

Tell what should be done rather than quering objects.


## 6. DRY

- Don't repeat yourself


## 7. Single Responsibility Principle

- a class should have only 1 reason to change

## 8. Don't Repeat yourself

- every piece of knowledge should have a single unambigious representation in the system.

## 9. Convention Over Configuration

- a rule(convention) is easier than configure each case in different way

## 10. Replace callback with a method

- callbacks should be avoided and used in moderation or not at all.

## 11. Replace mixin with composition

## 12. Replace subclasses with strategies

## 13. Inject Dependencies

## 14. Inline class

- remove class and inline into 1-2 methods

## 15. Move method

- where it belongs better

## 16. Use Class as a Factory

## 17. Introduce Parameter Object

- when arguments becomes too long and it is better to group them

## 18. Introduce Form Object

## 19. Introduce Explaining Variable

## 20. Extract Validator

## 21. Extract Partial
