### 1. Dependency Inversion Principle
- High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
- Abastractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon absractions.

### Why:

> If you push your dependency decision up until they reach the level that contains the information needed to make decisions -> you will prevent changes from affectings several layers.

### Drawbacks
- more absractions
- more indirection
- more difficulty
